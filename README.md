# Quotes on Dev

In this project, I used both WordPress and JavaScript to build a dynamic website called Quotes on Dev, where anyone is able to click show me another quote, and a random quote would appear. Also used JS to create a functional submit button for the ADMIN. 

#Tools Used 

This project combined the following:

HTML, SCSS, JS, PHP, GULP, WORDPRESS

#Outcomes

Trying to wrap my head around AJAX with the WP Rest API for the first time definetely took some time. However after understanding the power behind it, I've learned that there are so many possibilities now.
